# MvcSampleApp

This is a sample app I had to do for an interview.
It is a bare-bone MVC app with AJAX calls to get data.


## Installation

Open with Visual Studio 2015 and run: Debug > Start Debugging


## Usage

The sample does not contain any data. The purpose of the project is to 
focus on UI and MVC pattern so data is hard coded in dummy EF-like context class.

The form can be used to perform two types of searches:

1) Security Code: if a symbol is matched exactly, it is returned in results table
   Use: YHOO, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL

2) Search for text: if any of the other (non symbol) fields contain the search 
   string they will be returned in results table
